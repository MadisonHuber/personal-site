        <p>
            In my time at UNC, I have focused primarily on computer science, taking courses on the foundations of programming, discrete structures, computer organization, data structures, models of language and computation, systems programming, and modern web development. I have also studied single and multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and digital logic and circuits. My liberal arts education has also taken me through courses in rhetoric, anthropology, astronomy, religion, and archaeology.

            In the fall of 2018 I worked on a research project through the English department which focused on gathering and analyzing information through data construction, markup, and metadata within Digital Humanities. Through this project, I applied my technical skills by using XML for markup, Tableau for visualizations of data, and Python scripts for text analysis in order to analyze historic documents found in UNC's Southern Historical Collection.

            Outside of UNC, I have completed Stanford's Introduction to Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera along with all corresponding exercises. I have also gone through MIT's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs course through the associated OpenCourseWare video lecture series and corresponding materials.
