    <p>Here are a few times outside of school and personal projects that I've learned new things and applied what I know.</p>
    <h2>Fidelity Investments Software Engineering Intern</h2>
    <p>This summer, I am interning at Fidelity Investments on the Health Solutions Benefits Digital Experience team. I've really enjoyed working with other people on real-life projects. It's been really cool to be surrounded by other people (outside of classes) who are actively interested in computer science, and on a related note my team has been phenomenal to work with. I've learned so much from them and the experience of working at Fidelity, from what the Agile way of working is like to how it feels actually having a work-life balance, which is basically unheard of during semesters that are always filled with classes and papers and exams and everything else.</p>
    <p>I've gone to lots of meetings in my time as an intern which has been good for getting a feel for the company as well as seeing how decisions are made and where the company is headed. It's also been really cool to see the focus everyone puts on exploring new technologies and ideas (and actually using them too). Before moving in a new direction, different tools are tried and compared and tested out in different combinations.</p>
    <p>
        The first area I got to work on in our project was in designing the structure of the database, dockerizing that MySQL database, and connecting to it from Node.js. I've also gotten to work with Vue.js and Handlebars, which was a good transition into what I'm working on now. Recently my work has been focused on web components, so I've been dealing more with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and tools like LitElement and Lerna. I've truly enjoyed being able to learn and apply so many new things with other people who are just as excited as I am about what they're doing.

    <h2>COMP110 TA</h2>
    <p>
        At UNC, I am a Teaching Assistant for the computer science department, more specifically <a href="https://comp110.com/">COMP110</a>, the introduction to programming class. Each semester roughly 600 students take the course, and it's a great experience to be a part of so many people's first encounter with computer science. I work with other TAs to produce lecture content, help students during in-class exercises and in office hours, create assignments and assessments, and produce review materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course is taught in TypeScript which makes it easy for students to create and share web applications. We want the content to be fun and easily accessible even to people who are new at computer science, which is a goal we have for the course and field as a whole as well. Each semester we host several events including a Diversity in Computer Science Panel and a hackathon, all of which are aimed at welcoming and encouraging all students when it comes to getting involved and continuing on with computer science.
