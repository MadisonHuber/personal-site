    <p>Here are a few times outside of school and personal projects that I've learned new things and applied what I know.</p>
    <h2>Fidelity Investments Software Engineering Intern</h2>
    <p>This past summer I was a software engineering intern at Fidelity Investments on the Health Solutions + Benefits Digital Experience team. I've really enjoyed working with other people on real-life projects. It's been really cool to be surrounded by other people (outside of classes) who are actively interested in computer science, and on a related note my team has been phenomenal to work with. I've learned so much from them and the experience of working at Fidelity, from what the Agile way of working is like to how it feels actually having a work-life balance, which is basically unheard of during semesters that are always filled with classes and papers and exams and everything else.</p>
    <p>I've gone to lots of meetings in my time as an intern which has been good for getting a feel for the company as well as seeing how decisions are made and where the company is headed. It's also been really cool to see the focus everyone puts on exploring new technologies and ideas (and actually using them too). Before moving in a new direction, different tools are tried and compared and tested out in different combinations.</p>
    <p>
        The first area I got to work on in our project was in designing the structure of the database, dockerizing that MySQL database, and connecting to it from Node.js. I've also gotten to work with Vue.js and Handlebars, which was a good transition into what I'm working on now. Recently my work has been focused on web components, so I've been dealing more with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and tools like LitElement and Lerna. I've truly enjoyed being able to learn and apply so many new things with other people who are just as excited as I am about what they're doing.

    <h2>UNC Computer Science TA</h2>
    <p>
        At UNC, I am a Teaching Assistant for the computer science department. I TA for <a href="https://comp110.com/">COMP110</a>, the introduction to programming class, and COMP290, a course focused on teaching students how to work in the command-line and how to use common tools such as git, vim, and grep.
    </p>
    <h3>COMP110</h3>
    <p>
        Each semester roughly 600 students take the course, and it's a great experience to be a part of so many people's first encounter with computer science. I work with other TAs to produce lecture content, help students during in-class exercises and in office hours, create assignments and assessments, and produce review materials. I also maintain the React application used to schedule TA office hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course is taught in TypeScript which makes it easy for students to create and share web applications. We want the content to be fun and easily accessible even to people who are new at computer science, which is a goal we have for the course and field as a whole as well. Each semester we host several events including a Diversity in Computer Science Panel and a hackathon, all of which are aimed at welcoming and encouraging all students when it comes to getting involved and continuing on with computer science.
    </p>
    <h3>COMP290</h3>
    <p>
        This course is new to the department, offering students a chance to learn and gain experience with many of the tools computer scientists use every day that don't get taught in other courses. In my internship this summer, it was expected that I knew a lot of these things, like how to navigate the file system, use git, and ssh into remote servers, to name a few. I'm excited to be a part of a course at Carolina that familiarizes students with these concepts and helps them learn how to use such resources before they are expected to know them in industry or other places.
