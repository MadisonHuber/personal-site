    <h2>Quizlet — Web Engineering Intern</h2>
    <p>
        This past summer I interned at Quizlet doing web engineering, which was an incredible experience for so many reasons. As someone who has used Quizlet throughout high school and during college, I was excited for the opportunity to contribute to something that has made such an impact on my educational experience. As you can see from the section below on my experiences as a Teaching Assistant at UNC, I am passionate about helping people learn, and it was amazing to work at a company that shares this goal and to collaborate with people who truly care about making a difference in how people learn. Additionally, I worked on the Marketplace team, so it was cool to explore part of the product that was new to me and understand how it fit into the company as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>I spent the beginning of my internship focused on backend development and learning how engineering at Quizlet works. This included participating in sprint processes and learning how project-level decisions are made. In addition to working with Hack and PHPUnit testing, I expanded my knowledge of the product development cycle by learning how other roles such as user research, analytics, and design shape the direction the team focuses on in different projects.</p>
    <p>Later in the summer I focused more on frontend development, working with React in TypeScript, testing with React Testing Library, and using Stylus for styling. I also learned how to work based off of designs in Figma and how to create A/B tests. This helped me understand concrete ways that users are considered during development, both in thinking about how they interact with features we're making as well as understanding how different features affect subsets of real users before permanently incorporating into the product for all users.</p>
    <p>This summer taught me that software engineering really is a collaborative field. Even on individual projects, other engineers discuss decisions around code structure or different avenues for implementation. They ask questions and work together to come up with solutions. Additionally, every piece of code undergoes code review by other team members before it can be merged and deployed to production. Over the course of the summer I learned so much from this, both about how to write better code and the importance of active collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>At Quizlet, there is a big emphasis on communication and feedback. Whether that comes through the attitude of transparency throughout people at different levels and on different teams within the company or through team-specific interactions, Quizletters genuinely want to work together and help each other learn. People regularly ask for feedback and give updates on progress, and there is a big focus on supporting one another however possible. This means treating each other like people and understanding that coworkers are more than just the code they write. This was a great environment to be part of, especially with the ever-changing situations of the outside world and all the unknown that came with that this summer. So much effort went into communication and forming personal connections with people especially since we were all working remote.</p>
    <p>In this internship I learned so much about engineering, product development, collaborating with engineers, interacting with people in different roles, working remote, forming connections with the people you work with, and how inspiring it is to work with people who are passionate about the impact they're making for students and lifelong learners. I am so grateful to have had this experience and I look forward to continuing to apply what I've learned in the future.</p>
    <h2>Fidelity Investments — Software Engineering Intern</h2>
    <p>During summer of 2019 I was a software engineering intern at Fidelity Investments on the Health Solutions + Benefits Digital Experience team. This was my first experience outside of UNC where I got to work with other software engineers, and it was really cool being surrounded by other people who are actively interested in computer science. I learned so much from my team, including what the Agile way of working is like, how to make decisions about which technologies to use, and how it feels actually having a work-life balance, which is basically unheard of during semesters that are always filled with classes and papers and exams and everything else.</p>
    <p>Being included in meetings was helpful for getting a feel for the company as well as how decisions are made. It was also really cool to see the focus everyone put on exploring new technologies and ideas (and actually using them, too). Before moving in a new direction, different tools were tried, compared, and tested out in different combinations.</p>
    <p>
        The first area I got to work on in our project was in designing the structure of the database, Dockerizing that MySQL database, and connecting to it from Node.js. I've also gotten to work with Vue.js and Handlebars, which was a good transition into what I learned about in the later weeks of the summer. This was mostly focused on web components, so I worked more with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and tools like LitElement and Lerna. I've truly enjoyed being able to learn and apply so many new things with other people who are just as excited as I am about what they're doing.

    <h2>UNC Computer Science TA</h2>
    <p>
        At UNC, I am a Teaching Assistant for the computer science department. I TA for <a href="https://comp110.com/">COMP110</a>, the introduction to programming class, and COMP290, a course focused on teaching students how to work in the command-line and how to use common tools such as git, vim, and grep.
    </p>
    <h3>COMP110</h3>
    <p>
        Each semester roughly 600 students take the course, and it's a great experience to be a part of so many people's first encounter with computer science. I work with other TAs to produce lecture content, help students during in-class exercises and in office hours, create assignments and assessments, and produce review materials. I also maintain the React application used to schedule TA office hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course is taught in TypeScript which makes it easy for students to create and share web applications. We want the content to be fun and easily accessible even to people who are new at computer science, which is a goal we have for the course and field as a whole as well. Each semester we host several events including a Diversity in Computer Science Panel and a hackathon, all of which are aimed at welcoming and encouraging all students when it comes to getting involved and continuing on with computer science.
    </p>
    <h3>COMP290</h3>
    <p>
        This course is new to the department, offering students a chance to learn and gain experience with many of the tools computer scientists use every day that don't get taught in other courses. In my internship this summer, it was expected that I knew a lot of these things, like how to navigate the file system, use git, and ssh into remote servers, to name a few. I'm excited to be a part of a course at Carolina that familiarizes students with these concepts and helps them learn how to use such resources before they are expected to know them in industry or other places.
