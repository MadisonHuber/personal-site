            Hi! I'm Madison Huber, a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love computer science because there are endless opportunities to explore and learn new things. Itâ€™s full of possibilities, but the programmer takes it and turns it into something expressive and powerful. The challenge of thinking about things in new ways is one of the aspects of computer science that fascinates me most and keeps me curious. I love that programming lets me start with what I know and build something completely new and unique from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within computer science, I've been especially interested in languages. I love learning what makes different languages unique and the reasons behind different language features. Different languages are used for different things and there are so many out there that I'm just beginning to explore, that it's tough to pick a favorite. Even so, TypeScript will always be special to me for so many reasons. It's such a nice superset of JavaScript that gives you such a nice sense of safety with the types, plus it was the first language I learned! A more recent favorite of mine is Rust. It's newer to me but there's something exciting about a language that is so strict giving you so much power and helping you know exactly what's happening with everything you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to computer science, I enjoy baking, listening to music, reading, watching the Office, and playing the piano if I can find one.
