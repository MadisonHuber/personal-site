        <h1>Projects I've Done</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In order from most to least recent, here are some of the proejcts I've worked on. Most of these projects
                can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/madisonhuber">GitHub</a>, aside from a few that either
                started as course projects or are internal tools for our teaching team.</p>
            <h2>Career110</h2>
            <p>I started a career exploration initiative within the team of TAs I work with. This has included creating
                events and resources as well as building a React application using TypeScript that interfaces with
                Airtable to provide a place for students to share about their experiences and learn about different
                types of opportunities. </p>
            <h2>MiniJava Compiler</h2>
            <p>This past semester I made a compiler for a subset of the Java language in Java. Supported features
                included scoped variables, fields, methods, access modifiers, qualified references, operator precedence,
                single- and multi- line comments, arrays, and objects. Building the compiler included phases of
                syntactic analysis (scanning with tokenization and parsing), abstract syntax tree generation and
                traversal, contextual analysis (identification and type checking), and code generation.</p>
            <h2>Personal Site</h2>
            <p>This site (the one you're currently at!) is currently made up of plain HTML and CSS and it is a place for
                me to keep track of what I've been up to.</p>
            <h2>Travel Blog</h2>
            <p>During summer of 2019 I studied abroad for a web development course and also traveled around Europe for a
                week before the class started, so while I was abroad I made a travel blog using HTML, CSS, TypeScript,
                React, Handlebars, Express, Netlify, MySQL, and AWS. It's accessible <a
                    href="https://travel-notes.netlify.app/">here</a> if you want to check it out.</a></p>
            <h2>Unix Utilities</h2>
            <p>This series of projects was completed in spring 2019 as part of the COMP590 Systems Programming course,
                though I added additional functionality and extensions along the way that were not required for
                coursework. They are all command-line applications written in Rust, and details about each are given
                below:</p>
            <div class="sub">
                <h3>egrep</h3>
                <p>
                    On this project, I worked with a peer, breaking the program into stages of tokenization, parsing,
                    construction of an NFA, and use of that NFA to test input strings against a regular expression. We
                    worked in a ping-pong pair-programming approach with test-driven development. There is support for
                    concatenating NFAs, and it is also possible to view DOT visualizations of the created NFAs.
                    Supported operations include concatenation, alternation (|), kleene star (*), any character (.), and
                    kleene plus (+).
                </p>
                <h3>bc</h3>
                <p>
                    I built up the Basic Calculator as a recursive descent parser. It takes in mathematical expressions
                    in infix notation and emits the equivalent postfix notation expression to be used with the dc
                    program in order to then perform the calculation. Additionally, I added support for exponentiation
                    and register assignment.
                </p>
                <h3>dc</h3>
                <p>
                    For the Desk Calculator, I tokenized input that came in the form of reverse-polish notation
                    mathematical expressions then implemented a stack machine to process the tokens and carry out their
                    instructions. Support for exponentiation and registers was also included.
                </p>
                <h3>echo</h3>
                <p>
                    This implementation includes support for select escape sequences and other options based on flags
                    passed in by the user.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Lisp in C</h2>
            <p>
                I made a Lisp interpreter in C by following Daniel Holden's <em>Build Your Own Lisp</em>. I further
                extended the Lisp I had implemented by adding additional operations such as exponentiation and modulus.
            </p>
            <h2>Scheme in Racket</h2>
            <p>
                I worked through <em>The Little Schemer</em> by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen to build an
                implementation of Scheme in Racket.
